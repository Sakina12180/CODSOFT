            <h3>Project 1 : Thaiger Gym</h3>
            <p>As a budding web designer, this project marks my first step into the world of front-end development. 
            <br> At college, I was tasked with creating a front-end design for a website on a topic of my choice, 
            <br> where I had the opportunity to apply my skills in HTML and CSS. This experience allowed me to not 
            <br> only showcase my technical knowledge but also to demonstrate my creativity and ability to learn quickly 
            <br> in the basics of web design. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the design process 
            <br> and web development fundamentals</p>

            <h3>Project 2 : Snakers</h3>
            <p>As part of my academic journey, I worked on a project where I was tasked with creating a website 
            <br> centered around a topic of my choice. This project provided me with the opportunity to apply my 
            <br> knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, while also allowing me to showcase my creativity 
            <br> and problem-solving skills. The goal was to deepen my understanding of React and JavaScript, focusing 
            <br> on their significance in building a dynamic, full-fledged website. </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 3 : Mindful Haven</h3>
            <p>In my second year, I undertook a field project where I conducted a survey among college students to 
            <br> better understand the mental health challenges they face. Based on the survey responses, I developed
            <br> a static website designed to address the fundamental needs of students with various sections whih helped 
            <br> in dealing with mental health issues. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing 
            <br> on delivering accessible and relevant support for students.</p>
